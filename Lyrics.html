        I don't feel a single thing
        Have the pills done too much?
        Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
        And now we're out of touch

        I've been driving in LA
        And the world it feels too big
        Like a floating ball that's bound to break
        Snap my psyche like a twig

        And I just wanna see
        If you feel the same as me

        Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
        Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
        Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
        'Cause you gotta survive

        Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
        Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
        Like your fresh outta love, but it's been in the air
        Am I past repair?

        A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
        A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
        A little bit tired of sinkin'
        There's water in my boat
        I'm barely breathin'
        Tryna stay afloat
        So I got these
        Quick repairs to cope

        Guess I'm just broken and broke

        The prescription on it's way
        With a name I can't pronounce
        And the dose I gotta take
        Boy, I wish that I could count

        'Cause I just wanna see
        If this could make me happy

        Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
        Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
        Like you're hanging by a thread but you gotta survive
        'Cause you gotta survive

        Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
        Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
        Like your fresh outta love, but it's been in the air
        Am I past repair?

        A little bit tired of tryin' to care when I don't
        A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope

        A little bit tired of sinkin'
        There's water in my boat
        I'm barely breathin'
        Tryna stay afloat
        So I got these
        Quick repairs to cope

        Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
        Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
        Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
        That's gotta survive
